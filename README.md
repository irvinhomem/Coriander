# Coriander
A Python Toolset for coordinating Android Emulator instances and Android Applications (APKs) 
in order to create /generate and collect realistic Datasets of Android Process Memory Metadata 
(... and in future, datasets of metadata of other forensic artifacts e.g. network traffic, 
logs, disk dumps, etc). 

For now, Machine Learning techniques are currently being applied on the metadata in order 
to assist in the triage of malicious android applications / misuse of processes for forensic
analysis.
